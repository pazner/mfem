Radiation-Diffusion Miniapp To-Do List

- Methods and Discretization
   - [ ] Nonlinear solver element-by-element
   - [x] Change of basis in saddle-point solver
   - [x] Non-unit coefficients in MMS
   - [x] 3D support

- Performance
   - [ ] Partial assembly
      - [ ] Mixed diverence integrator
      - [ ] Change of basis
   - [ ] Device support
   - [x] Parallelization

- Code Quality
   - [ ] Better organization (friend classes, nonlinear integrator, etc.)

- Interface
   - [ ] Allow saddle-point solver to accept two coefficients as input
   - [ ] Allow saddle-point solver to accept DenseTensor as input
      - In this case, the coefficient comes from a QuadratureFunctionCoefficient

Overall to-dos:

- [ ] Clean up DG mass inverse interface
- [ ] Coefficient support

Element-by-element solver:

- Parallelization on GPU?

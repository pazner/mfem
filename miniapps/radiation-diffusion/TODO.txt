PR split:
- [ ] Minor adjustments PR
- [ ] DG mass inverse PR
- [ ] Radiation-diffusion miniapp PR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall to-dos:

- [ ] Clean up DG mass inverse interface

Future work:

- [ ] QuadratureFunctionCoefficient for the face integrator
- [ ] Partial assembly for VectorFEBoundaryFluxLFIntegrator
- [ ] Nonlinear solver element-by-element

- Interface
   - [ ] Allow saddle-point solver to accept two coefficients as input
   - [ ] Allow saddle-point solver to accept DenseTensor as input
      - In this case, the coefficient comes from a QuadratureFunctionCoefficient
   - [ ] Variable coefficient formulation for saddle-point system
